# MySQL Project: Study &Practice2023-24

## Overview
Welcome to my MySQL project developed during the academic year 2023-24! This project showcases my skills in database design, data analysis, and problem-solving using MySQL.

## Features
- **Database Schema**: Describe your database schema and its components.
- **Queries and Operations**: Highlight key SQL queries or operations implemented.
- **Analysis and Insights**: Summarize any insights or analytics derived from the data.
- **Technologies Used**: List the technologies, tools, and languages used in the project.

## Example Queries
```sql
-- Example 1: Retrieve all customers from the database
SELECT * FROM customers;

-- Example 2: Calculate total sales for the year 2023
SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM orders
WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2023;

-- Example3:Find top-selling products
SELECT product_name, SUM(quantity) AS total_sold
FROM order_details
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY total_sold DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Example4: Identify customers with the highest purchase amount

SELECT customer_name, SUM(amount) AS total_purchased
FROM customers
JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
GROUP BY customer_name
ORDER BY total_purchased DESC
LIMIT 5;
